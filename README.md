# Golang Project : Groupie Trackers

## How to start the site

* First of all, you have to go in the folder groupie-tracker so :

    - cd groupie-tracker
    - go run main.go

The used localhost is localhost:8080


* So for running the main page, you can use the LiveServer extension or click on the index.html.
    - If you do that then you will have the page with an animation but not the site with golang.

* Dont exitate to zoom-in or zoom-out your navigator screen with : ctrl + / ctrl - / ctrl scroll wheel.

# Description 

Our project is a site for searching your favorite artist using the language Golang
We have to use a RESTFUL API

With this project, we learn how to use **an API**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

## Authors

Code writted by **CLAVERIA André**, **COURTEAUX Damien**, **MOYEN Noé**, **MORACCHINI Florian**

## How does the page work

1. When you arrive on the index.html, you can click on the arrow to see the rest of the page.

2. When you click on the button Let's go! You enter on the main page.

3. In the main page, you will have cards with all artists.

4. You can click on the card for information on them.

5. On the top you can search the artist with the ID. (1-52). You have a button called Tinder.

6. When you click in the Tinder... you will see what it does ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)


------------------------

## Algorithm detail

* We used the following method to code :

* The template, html and CSS for the web part of the project

* JavaScript for the animation.

* Golang for the back.
